When specifying a type parameter, you can create an upper bound that declares the super class from which all type arguments must be derived.
• This is accomplished through the use of an extends clause when specifying
the type parameter

	<T extends Superclass>

• This specifies that T can only be replaced by super class, or sub classes of super class. Thus, super class defines an inclusive, upper limit.

WILDCARD IN GENERIC PROGRAMMING
. The question mark symbol (?) is known as the wildcard in generic programming in Java.

. Whenever you need to represent an unknown type, you can do that with ?.

. Java generic's wildcard is a mechanism to cast a collection of a certain class.

BOUNDED WILDCARD ARGUMENTS
1. Upper Bounded wildcard
<type> methodUBA(? extends A) {...}

2. Lower Bounded arguments
<type> methodLBA  (? super A) {...}

3.Unbounded wildcard
<type> methodNBA(?) {...}
